The app uses vanilla JavaScript to create a simple grocery list using CRUD operations. It utilizes functions to create UI components, Local Storage operations, and display alert banners. The app was created entirely by following the video.

ChatGPT was used to debug a mistake that I made while following along. The console kept saying that the local storage array was "undefined". Since I have a background mostly in Java, I was a little confused when following along that I completely missed crucial return statement in the "getLocalStorage()" function. In Java, I'm so used to declaring so much information in the method creation. I simply overlooked that the array needed to be returned and forgot to type "return". After putting the entire code into ChatGPT, it showed me that it was all I needed to do to make the app worked as intended.
